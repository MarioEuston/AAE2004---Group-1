<!--ABOUT THE PROJECT-->
## Background of Path Planning in Aviation Engineering
 


## Theory of Path Planning Algorithm
  Path planning is one of the most critical research problems in robotics. By proposing path planning, many problems in various fields are solved. It has been applied to guide robots to achieve specific goals, from very simple trajectory planning to choosing an appropriate sequence of actions. By proposing suitable algorithms,path planning can be widely applied in partial and unknown structured environments.Local path planning generates paths by acquiring data from sensors during robot motion. Therefore, the robot can generate new paths based on the new environment. It makes this approach more applicable in practice.There are four essential predominant trade-off criteria that must be considered in a path planning algorithm: optimization, completeness, precision and execution time.

### Github
  GitHub is a commercial website and is currently the largest Git Server in the world. Here, you can make friends with other great programmers, you can help contribute   to other people's projects, and others can also give back to your projects, creating a virtuous circle. At the same time, it is also the best resume for developers.   It is clear at a glance which projects you have done, which contributions you have made, and which Codes you have written. It is difficult and nearly impossible to     counterfeit. In Github is also a location that you can save your code and project that you have done. It will automatically help you record code changes, and when necessary, can help you quickly roll back to the previous historical version. There are many excellent and famous open-source projects shared above. You can use and   download these open-source projects for free under the premise of complying with their licenses. This is also the most attractive part of GitHub. One of its major     advantages is collaborative development. The projects you share, other developers can also contribute to help you improve project functions, fix bugs, and improve code quality.

  
## Task 1 : Methodology Results and Discusssion
### Methodology
  For the first task, for three different scenarios, we mneed to find the most cost effective aircraft.For solving this task, first we changed the codes of the borders of the cost intensive areas to match them with our scenarios. Then we changed the range to numpy arange to make the border such as the aircraft can pass through it. Then we added the conditions of the three scenarios provided and that of the aircrafts in our code. Then we added a calculating system in our code so that it can calculate how much cost each aircraft would have by analyzing all the data we provided.
### Result
  The most suitable aircrafts for the first,second and third scenario are A330, A350 and A330 respectively.
### Discussion
  The first task was to find out an appropriate aircraft model that achieve minimum cost for the challenge assigned.The first scenario is to consider 3000 passengers travelling within one week when the maximum number of flights that we can afford is 12 per one week. The time cost should be medium and the fuel cost should be 0.76$/kg. Considering this scenario the most appropriate aircraft is A330-900neo.In this case, A321 can't meet the requirements. And the cost of aircraft A350 is much more than A330. The second scenario is where 1250 passengers travel within this month and we can afford 5 flights per week which makes it 20 flights per month.In this scenario the most profitable aircraft model is A350-900. And the third scenario is where 2500 passengers need to travel within this week and only 25 flights can be afforded within this week.Considering the circumstamces of this particular scenario the best aircraft model is A330-900neo because it is the most cost effective. 

  
## Task 2 : Methodology Results and Discussion
### Methodology
  For the second task, we needed to design another cost effective area which can reduce the cost of the route.First, we created an area similiar to the cost intensive area but change the values to negetive in order to reduce the cost. Then we designed the jet stream area in the location where the aircraft makes three turns.
### Results
  It is seen that the cost was reduced because of the planning of the jet stream area compared to that of Task 1.
### Discussion
  For the first scenario of 3000 passengers travelling within one week when 12 flights are available per week, A330 was the most suitable aircraft before the jet stream area was introduced with the cost of 91816$. But when the jet stream area was introduced, the cost reduced to 91544$. For the second scenario, the most suitable flight was A350 with the cost of 48329$ which was reduced to 48183$ with the introduction of the jet stream area. Similiarly it is seen that for the third scenario the most appropriate and cost effective aircraft to choose was A330 which had cost lower than the other two models. But the addition of the jet stream area further reduced it's cost from 90222$ to 89948$.
