## Background of Path Planning in Aviation Engineering
  "write here kingslay"

## Theory of Path Planning Algorithm
  Path planning is one of the most critical research problems in robotics. By proposing path planning, many problems in various fields are solved. It has been applied   to guide robots to achieve specific goals, from very simple trajectory planning to choosing an appropriate sequence of actions. By proposing suitable algorithms,       path planning can be widely applied in partial and unknown structured environments.
  Local path planning generates paths by acquiring data from sensors during robot motion. Therefore, the robot can generate new paths based on the new environment. It   makes this approach more applicable in practice.
  There are four essential predominant trade-off criteria that must be considered in a path planning algorithm: optimization, completeness, precision                     and execution time.
  
  
## Introduction of the Engineering Tools
  GitHub is a commercial website and is currently the largest Git Server in the world. Here, you can make friends with other great programmers, you can help contribute   to other people's projects, and others can also give back to your projects, creating a virtuous circle. At the same time, it is also the best resume for developers.   It is clear at a glance which projects you have done, which contributions you have made, and which Codes you have written. It is difficult and nearly impossible to     counterfeit. In Github is also a location that you can save your code and project that you have done. It will automatically help you record code changes, and when     necessary, can help you quickly roll back to the previous historical version. There are many excellent and famous open-source projects shared above. You can use and   download these open-source projects for free under the premise of complying with their licenses. This is also the most attractive part of GitHub. One of its major     advantages is collaborative development. The projects you share, other developers can also contribute to help you improve project functions, fix bugs, and             improve code quality.

  
## Task 1 : Methodology Results and Discusssion
  The first task was to find out an appropriate aircraft model that achieve minimum cost for the challenge assigned.
  The first scenario is to consider 3000 passengers travelling within one week when the maximum number of flights that we can afford is 12 per one week. The time cost   should be medium and the fuel cost should be 0.76$/kg. Considering this scenario the most appropriate aircraft is A330-900neo. The second scenario is where 1250       passengers to travel within this month and we can afford 5 flights per week which makes it 20 flights per month.In this scenario the most profitable aircraft model     is A350-900.
