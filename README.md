<!--ABOUT THE PROJECT-->
## Background of Path Planning in Aviation Engineering
Finding a geometric route that avoids obstacles and establishes a most suitable path from the vehicle's current location to it's destination is generally referred to as path planning[1].It is one of the most signifacnt aspects to consider when it comes to vehicle navigation. Path planning in the aviation engineering sector is generally creating a flight plan to outline a potential aircraft flight. Two safety-critical components are involved in this process which are the correct fuel calculations to ensure that the aircraft can land safely, and adherence to air traffic control regulations to reduce the chance of midair accidents.  A flight planning system can save costs for any route by determining the fastest speed at any altitude and can also figure out the best altitude to use based on the forecasted weather. In aviation engineering, path planning is used to ensure that the most appropriate route for the flight is chosen and that that the flight crew doesn't face any unwanted midair crisis[2].


## Theory of Path Planning Algorithm
  Path planning is one of the most critical research problems in robotics. By proposing path planning, many problems in various fields are solved. It has been applied to guide robots to achieve specific goals, from very simple trajectory planning to choosing an appropriate sequence of actions. By proposing suitable algorithms,path planning can be widely applied in partial and unknown structured environments.Local path planning generates paths by acquiring data from sensors during robot motion. Therefore, the robot can generate new paths based on the new environment. It makes this approach more applicable in practice.There are four essential predominant trade-off criteria that must be considered in a path planning algorithm which are optimization, completeness, precision and execution time respectively[3].

  
## Introduction of the Engineering Tools

### Python
  Python is an object-oriented, interpreted, high-level, dynamically semantic programming language. It is particularly desirable for Rapid Application Development as well as for usage as a scripting or glue language to tie existing components together due to its dynamic binding, dynamic typing, and high-level built-in data structures. Python's straightforward syntax prioritizes readability and makes it simple to learn, which lowers the cost of program maintenance. Python's support for modules and packages promotes the modularity and reuse of code in programs. For all popular platforms, the Python interpreter and the comprehensive standard library are freely distributable and available in source or binary form[4].

The edit-test-debug cycle is extraordinarily quick because there is no compilation step. Python programs are simple to debug since a segmentation failure is never caused by a bug or incorrect input. Instead, the interpreter raises an exception when it finds a mistake. The interpreter prints a stack trace if the application doesn't catch the exception. Setting breakpoints, evaluating arbitrary expressions, inspecting local and global variables, stepping through the code one line at a time, and other features are all possible with a source-level debugger. Python's ability to perform introspection is demonstrated by the debugger, which is developed in Python. Contrarily, adding a few print statements to a program is frequently the easiest method to debug it[5].

### Github
  GitHub is a commercial website and is currently the largest Git Server in the world. Here, a programmer can collaborate with other great programmers, can help contribute   to other people's projects, and others can also give back to his/her projects, creating a virtuous circle. At the same time, it is also the best resume for developers.   It is clear at a glance and is also to keep track of which projects a programmer has done, which contributions they have made, and which codes they have written[6]. It is difficult and nearly impossible to     counterfeit. In Github, a programmer can also select a location and save their codes and the projects they have done. It will automatically record code changes, and when necessary, can help programmers roll back to the previous historical version. There are many excellent and famous open-source projects shared in Github. Programmers can use and   download these open-source projects for free under the premise of complying with their licenses for many purposes including learning. This is also the most attractive part of GitHub. One of its major     advantages is collaborative development. The projects shared by the programmers can also be improved by other developers which result in improved project functions, fixed bugs and better code quality.

  
## Task 1 : Methodology Results and Discusssion
### Methodology
  For the first task, for three different scenarios, we mneed to find the most cost effective aircraft.For solving this task, first we changed the codes of the borders of the cost intensive areas to match them with our scenarios. Then we changed the range to numpy arange to make the border such as the aircraft can pass through it. Then we added the conditions of the three scenarios provided and that of the aircrafts in our code. Then we added a calculating system in our code so that it can calculate how much cost each aircraft would have by analyzing all the data we provided.
### Result
  The most suitable aircrafts for the first,second and third scenario are A330, A350 and A330 respectively.

### Discussion
  The first task was to find out an appropriate aircraft model that achieve minimum cost for the challenge assigned.The first scenario is to consider 3000 passengers travelling within one week when the maximum number of flights that we can afford is 12 per one week. The time cost should be medium and the fuel cost should be 0.76$/kg. Considering this scenario the most appropriate aircraft is A330-900neo.In this case, A321 can't meet the requirements. And the cost of aircraft A350 is much more than A330. The second scenario is where 1250 passengers travel within this month and we can afford 5 flights per week which makes it 20 flights per month.In this scenario the most profitable aircraft model is A350-900. And the third scenario is where 2500 passengers need to travel within this week and only 25 flights can be afforded within this week.Considering the circumstamces of this particular scenario the best aircraft model is A330-900neo because it is the most cost effective. 

  
## Task 2 : Methodology Results and Discussion
### Methodology
  For the second task, we needed to design another cost effective area which can reduce the cost of the route.First, we created an area similiar to the cost intensive area but change the values to negetive in order to reduce the cost. Then we designed the jet stream area in the location where the aircraft makes three turns.
### Results
  It is seen that the cost was reduced because of the planning of the jet stream area compared to that of Task 1.
  
Task 2

 ![Task 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116062601/202096447-cb860a19-85da-46b5-998a-45de78db0f57.gif) 
  
  Output

![Task 2](Gif%20and%20Data/GIF/Task%202.png)

### Discussion

  For the first scenario of 3000 passengers travelling within one week when 12 flights are available per week, A330 was the most suitable aircraft before the jet stream area was introduced with the cost of 91816$. But when the jet stream area was introduced, the cost reduced to 91544$. For the second scenario, the most suitable flight was A350 with the cost of 48329$ which was reduced to 48183$ with the introduction of the jet stream area. Similiarly it is seen that for the third scenario the most appropriate and cost effective aircraft to choose was A330 which had cost lower than the other two models. But the addition of the jet stream area further reduced it's cost from 90222$ to 89948$.
  
## Task 3 : Methodology Results and Discussion
### Methodology
In this task, we designed two aircrafts, the first one is a big aircraft carrying four engines with passenger capacity (450>= number of passengers >300 passengers). The other one is smaller aircraft carrying twin engines and lower passenger capacity (<= 299 passengers). For convenience, we are using A1 to represent the big aircraft and A2 to represent the smaller aircraft. In fact, these two aircrafts are the both possible best option for the flight, so we were using python coding to compare the differences of the data between them.

### Results
After the coding processing, the result shows A1 is the best aircraft option. 
  
  Task 3

  Output

  ![Task 3](Gif%20and%20Data/GIF/Task%203.png)

### Discussion
In our coding process, we can get the fuel cost of A1 is 80, the fuel cost of A2 is 40. So the fuel cost of big aircraft is higher than the smaller aircraft. The passenger capacity of A1 is 450, A2 is 299. Hence the passenger capacity of big aircraft is more than small aircraft 151 . The time cost medium of A1 is 24, A2 is 30. The time cost medium of smaller aircraft is more than the big aircraft that means smaller aircrafts need more time for the operation. The fix cost of A1 is 2000, A2 is 2500. The fix cost of small aircraft is higher than the big aircraft. Under calculated the cost of both big and small aircraft by using the formula trip cost equation, we can get the result is using big aircraft is the best choice. 

  
  
## Additional Task 1: Methodology Results and Discussion
### Methodology
   We divide the whole journey into three routes (start point to end point). First, we set the start point at where the plane located. We set the first checkpoint (the    nearer one) as the end point simultaneously. When the plane arrives to the first checkpoint, we change that checkpoint as the start point. Then the remaining          checkpoint as the end point. Same logic, when the plane arrives to the second checkpoint, it becomes the start point and the destination become end point. 
### Results
  The cost is added due to the plane fly through two cost intensive areas.

  Output

  ![AT1](Gif%20and%20Data/GIF/AT1.jpeg)


### Discussion
  In this task, we calculate the total distance of the flight. We set three variables for the distance between checkpoint and checkpoint. Then we sum the variables up,   the total flight distance can be found. We can use it for calculating the flight cost and different data of the plane. After compare the distance of with checkpoint   and without checkpoint, we find that the main factor affecting the flight time and cost are total trip time. In our scenario, the flight time with checkpoint is       around 159% more than without checkpoint. To conclude, if checkpoint is added, the flight time most likely be increased. Unless the checkpoint lies on the shortest     flight route, then the flight time will remain the same. Thus, the time and cost will be increases.
  
  
## Additional Task 2: Methodology Results and Discussion
### Methodology
To commence with, a random function is used in the domain between x=-10 to x =30,y=-10 to y=30, so that only the fuel-consuming area remains and generated randomly with a fixed area.	The Diagonal movement is disabled by deleting the diagonal square root function. Through reducing the radius from 1 to 0.5 , the object could travel within one grid size. Since the path fails to present when the density is higher than 2400, 2000 is a suitable range of density. By setting up a function to calculate their distance, once it is detected lower than 50, reset the random function. Destination and starting points could be generated randomly with at least a 50- unit distance in-between. Also, print the cost intensive area before printing the obstacle, so that it will not be covered. Lastly, through blocking the coordinates of starting point and goal point by +1 and -1 respectively, obstacles would not be generated near the start and end point.

### Results
The density of obstacles is inversely proportional to the rate of success of the flight planning.

### Discussion
As the obstacle becomes more dense in a certain area, it makes the route planning more difficult, furthermore the flight will be more difficult to process. We set up an experiment by changing the density of the obstacles as major variable , while to find out the rate of success in the planning of another, in order to see if there is any kind of relation between the density and the flight successful rate. During the experiment, we operate the flight planning in a certain times with different density of obstacles. It has been found out that there are 100% success when the number of obstacles is lower than 2000; when the number of obstacles reach 2500 , there are only 5 success in total of 10 trials ; the success rate drop to zero when there are over 3000 number of obstacles. Hence, lower the density of obstacle can enhance the success of the flight planning.

  
  
## Additional Task 3: Methodology Results and Discussion

### Methodology
  In this task, we need to compare two different algorithms to with Astar, we use the method same as above in the domain between x=-10 to x =30, y=-10 to y=30, we       chose 2 among 43 algorithms, which are Dijkstra Planning and Probabilistic Road-Map. First, we started with Dijkstra Planning. Dijkstra Planning spreads out cyan       points from the starting point, which are some searched nodes, to find the end point, and then locate the shortest path. Then, we use the Probabilistic Road-Map,       which is based on Dijkstra but with a simpler approach to the goal points, this algorithm randomly spread out consideration points on the grid to find the shortest     path by linking   up the suitable points, there will be a cross on the suitable points for displaying the shortest path. 
  
### Results 
  
  Additional task 3 - Dijkstra Algorithm

  ![AT3 - Dijkstr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116062601/202213338-cfda49fb-b38f-45a0-badc-e5d5d5a15555.gif)

  Output of Dijkstra

  Output of Probabilistic Road-Map

  ![AT3 - PRM](Gif%20and%20Data/GIF/AT3%20-%20PRM(2).png)

### Discussion
  After applying Dijkstra Planning and Probabilistic Road-Map to the same scenario to find the shortest path, we can see the difference between these two algorithms     and A star. First, Dijkstra is simpler than Astar and can find more possibilities, however, it operates slower because it is less smart, therefore it is not as good   as Astar. Next, PRM is also simpler than Astar, and operates faster than Astar although it is randomly spreading out points. This algorithm is more complex but it is   more convenient on operation, therefore it is better than Astar. 
  
## Reflective Essays
### AISHY Prithula Prashun
  The concept of programming is a relatively new concept to me as I am still an amateur programmer but this project has helped me develop a clearer view of coding and learn new concepts and methodologies. We have learnt about path planning and this journey has been really engaging and enjoyable. GitHub was a new experience for all of us in our group. But we co-operated, helped each other and learnt how to navigate through GitHub. And as GitHub is an open-source coding platform, we were able to take a look at and learn from projects done by other expert programmers and use that knowledge to develop our project. This project has also taught us how to collaborate on a global programming platform, think outside the box, challenge ourselves by going out of our comfort zone and expose ourselves to new and foreign concepts with an open mind. I'd also like to thank my groupmates, specially Victor and Euston, for being supportive and encouraging. Everyone helped in any way they could and took part in the project. We hope that going forward, we will be able to maintain this outlook and utilize the skills that this project has help us build.
### AU Cheuk Hei
  The time spending on working for the project is fruitful, I have learnt so much things in whether practical and technical criteria. To commence with, I had equipped with new knowledge and experience regarding python. To tackle the problems by GitHub has trained our mind and skill of solving. It is also remarkable and exciting to create our own route planning code. Apart from that, cooperating with others has enhanced my sense of the team spirit. It is my deeply honor to be in project group1. As one of the all freshman of AAE, it is beyond the shadow to see that every groupmates in group 1 is friendly and kind to give a helping hand. We all share a positive altitude against this project. It is so exciting to feel the passion of all of us on aviation and this project. Personally, I would like to send a special thanks to my teammate Victor, he is patient and talented, he helped me a lot in the area of problem solving. Last but not least during this project with my groupmates, I have also understood the responsibility of a aviation career. It shows my respect on aviation industry. Looking forward to be a part of the aviation system in the future.
### CAI Jialiang
  I am Caijialiang, one of the programmer of our group. During this GitHub group assignment, I’ve learnt a lot. I am new to python, some of the problems with this group assignment used to give me a headache. But luckily we managed to complete the project in the end. This project has definitely increased my skills in writing code snippets. It also made me feel how hard it is to write a flight system. Respect to those who work in the aviation industry! I would also like to thank my group members. Thanks to their help, our group has been ahead of other groups in terms of project progress. Thanks to our group leader, Chan Pak Lam, He is very patient and responsible and has great leadership skills. I feel very lucky to be placed in this group.
### CHAN Cheuk Hin
In this activity, I don’t believe that I can finish all the task  without their help.  I am new to Github and Python. I took part in writing report and video recording. As I need to co-operate with different members, I understand everyone’s difficulties in their part . I experienced the importance of teamwork while working with my group mates. During the tasks, I know more about python. I gained one more programming language among C++. Also, using of Github allows me to learn more about others work. When we have coding problems, we can see others solution and it benefits me from self-learning. Other than programming, I learn more about aviation knowledge.
Our group has a good team-spirit,which makes me become motivated. It is my honour to be in this group. I appreciate Mario, Aishy and Jayden. They did pay a lot effort in this project. Also, thanks to rest of the group mates. After I did this task, I deeply understood aviation industry is not easy job and responsibility. Although It is truth, I hope I can take part in this industry in the future.
### CHAN Ho Chun
### CHAN Kuen Fai
This GitHub Project is my very first time to use this platform to do a project, it is interesting. However, the coding and programming field is very difficult for us as we all are a beginner in this field, especially I am a “computer stupid” so I am not familiar with the coding and programming. Fortunately, I have some very clever, smart and talented groupmates who took part in the coding part, thus I took part in writing the report and editing the presentation video to contribute our project. In this project, I realised the importance of the groupmates because they can save your life when you are dealing with some problems or struggles that unsolvable by yourself so your groupmate’s brain is a very good tool and here I need to thank my groupmates again, they are kind and friendly to give a helping hand. Besides, I have improved my skill in video editing field. The last but not least, This project given me a new eyesight on how coding and programing works in aviation industry, it was a very good experience and new knowledge for me. 

### CHAN Pak Lam
  Throughout this experience of working in both GitHub and python coding about path planning, I have gained much experience on how to make code and gain more knowledge on python coding. Making use of the Microsoft code to make our own path planning code and visualize the results was extremely extraordinary and thrilling. GitHub is also another new platform to me which I have never encountered before. The platform shows different kinds of special codes by other contributors. By studying these codes, I think we might learn more coding principles and how we can make a better and organized code.
  Another special feature of github is the encourgement of open sources, github is one of a special platform where it allows everyone to contribute their codes or knowledges to the world. This vitrual platform allows everyone around the world to see and exchange their point of view and knowledge to others. Open source also allow people in enchancing their own source or fix bugs in the code. By this method of sharing, people also know more and imporve the usages of python. However, the sources and code may be modified by everyone globally. Thurs, it is more essential for respository's admin to read and check the accurancy of the code modified. The traceability of github is also important to the aviation industry as is provide securcity to the system.
  Lastly, as a group leader of group 1, I would like to thank my groupmates who have contributed tremendously. Without their help, I don't think the group project will ever run that smoothly.
